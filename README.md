## 🏰 The Dungeon System

Your fitness performance directly impacts your survival.

- Stronger stats increase damage, stamina, survivability, and critical chance
- Boss fights become tougher at higher tiers
- Strategic decisions matter in combat
- No two dungeon runs feel exactly the same

This transforms fitness tracking into an RPG progression experience instead of just counting reps.
